## Gamez eM
Gamez eM is a web application focused on providing all the necessary tools for both game development and is also a game hosting, streaming and downloading site.
The above platform is a one stop shop for everything concerning games and gaming and also focuses on impacting the young and ethusiast gamers in the continent.
The platform is one of its kind since it has both experienced nerds and the newbies who have passion and interest in gaming world.
The uniqueness of this site is that its both an educational site and enjoyment site with all the resources in one place.
One can always decide to make their own open sorce projects, host them on the platform and get others on board to assist on the development and success of that project.
The platform is designed in a way that not all games are free nor for subscription but there are categories and most product are found in the subscription package
Signing in the platform has been made very easy and one is only prompted to do so when he/she wants to subscribe to the premium package or wants to learn on the platform.
The application is an online based app with both games for streaming and games for downloading and can be played offline.
The application is also designed in a way that favours self learning with different videos from experts explaining the way through which games are built from scratch to fialization. With AI based tools neccessary for  game development and intergration.
Languages for video game development and APIs needed for such activities are also present in the platform.
The platforms front-end has been developed using languages such as HTML/CSS and javascript and for the backend, python node and SQL has played major roles in making the site live.

## Inspirations
The inspirations behind the above project can be channeled to the few and less involvement in gaming industry in Africa.
The industry is mostly dominated by other countries which have enough resourses for creation, maintenance and development of games and gaming industry.
This really made me curious and thats why I have always wanted to make Africa and Africans have a platform to tell their stories and and showcase their talents through inventions and inovations in the tech industry.
It is also a platform where one can learn and also volunteer to teach others through different projects and collaborations.

## Project & Collaboration
The above project has been spearheader and brought into life by a passionate tech enthusiast Clin
All the materials used in the project are available on my official pages and blog posts where I have expalined how the site works, components and different technologies concerning the site.
